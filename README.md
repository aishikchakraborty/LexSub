# LexSub:Learning Lexical Relations in a Distributional Vector Space

This repository is the official implementation of [LexSub: Learning Lexical Relations in a Distributional Vector Space](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/tacl_a_00316).



 ![LexSub vs Retrofitting Approaches ](img/Concept.png "LexSub Approach" ) 

LexSub is a framework to unify lexical and distributional semantics by defining lexical subspaces of the distributional vector space (word embeddings) in which a lexical relation should hold. LexSub can handle symmetric attract and repel relations (e.g., synonymy and antonymy, respectively), as well as asymmetric relations (e.g., hypernymy and meronomy).

## Pre-trained Models
You can download post-hoc retrofitted embeddings from here:
* [glove-6B-300d](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DtMLJzvwfak25PoRrt5Wq4_3w9x7r8Yy/view?usp=sharing)

We will release new embeddings soon.

## Training LexSub Embeddings from Scratch:

## Installation Instructions:

### Requirements:
* python3
* pytorch==0.4.1
* GloVe 6B.300d embeddings.

Create a virtual env, clone the repository, and then run
```
virtualenv ./env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create the data directory and download GloVe embeddings.
```
mkdir -p data/glove; cd data/glove;
wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip .
unzip glove.6B.zip;
cd ../../;
python preprocessing/glove/create_proper_files.py data/glove/glove.6B.300d.txt data/glove/vocab.txt;

cd extrinsic_tasks/;
unzip datasets.zip;
cd ../;
```

## Preprocessing data:
Preprocessing to annotate GloVe vocab with their WordNet relations:
```
python preprocessing/main.py --model retro --data data/glove/
```

## Training LexSub model:
